3.	Modify your previous query to add a column that will subtract the old salary from the new salary. Label the column Increase. Rerun your query.

5.	For each employee display the employee name and calculate the number of months between today and the date the employee was hired. Label the column MONTHS_WORKED. Order your results by the number of months employed. Round the number of months up to the closest whole number.
	SELECT ENAME ,ROUND((SYSDATE - HIREDATE)/12) "MONTHS WORKED" FROM EMP
    ORDER BY "MONTHS WORKED"
6.	Write a query that produces the following for each employee: <employee name> earns <salary> monthly but wants <3 times salary>. Label the column Dream Salaries.

FROM EMP

M. Give each column an appropriate label.
=> select initcap(ename) "Name"
from emp
where ename like 'J%' or ename like 'A%' or ename like 'M%'
order by ename;

8.	Create a query that will display the employee name and commission amount. If the employee does not earn commission, put “No Commission.” Label the column COMM.

=> select ename, nvl(to_char(comm), 'No commission') as comm from emp;

	SELECT DEPTNO,AVG(SAL), MAX(SAL) , MIN(SAL) FROM EMP GROUP BY DEPTNO
3.	Find average, maximum, minimum salary of the employees according to job category.
	SELECT JOB,AVG(SAL), MAX(SAL) , MIN(SAL) FROM EMP GROUP BY JOB
4.	Find the name of lowest paid manager. (Manager is not Job).
	SELECT ename from emp where sal=(select min(sal) from emp where empno=any (select distinct mgr from emp));


5.	Find the location where maximum number of employee is located
	SELECT deptno from emp group by deptno having count(*)=( select max(count(*)) from emp group by deptno)
	
6.	Find out job group having highest amount of total salary. (Sal + comm)

	SELECT JOB , SUM(SAL+NVL(COMM,0)) FROM EMP
GROUP BY JOB HAVING SUM(SAL+NVL(COMM,0)) = (SELECT MAX(SUM(SAL+NVL(COMM,0)))FROM EMP GROUP BY JOB)
7.	Suppose you need to know the name and department no. of the employee who earns the highest salary. Write a SQL query to return this information.
=>  select ename,deptno from emp where sal =(select max(sal)from emp);
