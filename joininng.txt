=> delete dept,emp from dept INNER JOIN emp ON dept.dname = emp.loc where dname is not null

7.Display all the departmental information for all the existing employees and if a department has no employees display it as “No employees”.
	SELECT dept.deptno, dept.dname, emp.empno, emp.ename FROM dept LEFT JOIN emp ON dept.deptno=emp.deptno ORDER BY dept.deptno
	select NVL2(ename,dname,'NO EMPLOYEE'),dname from emp,dept where emp.deptno(+)=dept.deptno;

8.Get all the matching & non-matching records from both the tables.
=> select emp.*,dept.* from emp,dept where dept.deptno=emp.deptno(+)

9.Get only the non-matching records from DEPT table (matching records shouldn’t be selected).
